# Data Dose - A Student Database Management 👩🏼‍🎓

This is a part of our SEM 3 Mini Project for Second Year Engineering and is purely team work 🤝.

## Problem Statement:

The Digital India campaign* paved way for a surge in web development. It revamped the Education sector from obsolete educational practices to a predominantly digital environment. This made maintenance of manual records inefficient and time-consuming. The Digital age demanded a management tool for educational institutions to collect and store data of all the students that was safe and easily accessible.  

Student Database Management Web application tackles all problems mentioned above catering to needs of the modern times. It allows students and teachers to share confidential data such as personal information and exam results in a proficient manner. Hence, all the data can be easily accessed by the teachers and the students with relative convenience.
